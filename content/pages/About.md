This website is a project I've procrastinated on for a long time (since 2013) - a digital headspace to record things I've learned throughout my personal and professional life.

I write about things I'm familiar with, stuff I do with my kids, and topics I've learned in my professional life and personal life.

I am still learning continuously to write and am very open to learning from mistakes, sharing experiences, and contributing back to the community. So if you would like to reach out, just leave a comment here or in the articles, or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spydermaxi).
